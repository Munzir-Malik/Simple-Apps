# Simple Apps Repository

Welcome to the **Simple Apps** repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing and showcasing the real-world applications Iâ€™ve developed to improve my programming skills.

## Overview

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a collection of simple yet practical applications that I have built using various programming languages. The primary goal of these projects is to apply the concepts I've learned and to demonstrate continuous improvement through different versions of each app.

### Current Focus

- **Java:** Currently, most of the applications in this repository are written in Java. This is the primary language I'm focusing on for now. Each app may have multiple versions, reflecting enhancements and optimizations as I continue learning.

### Key Features
  
- **Real-World Applications:** The projects here are inspired by real-world problems and scenarios, providing hands-on experience in solving practical issues.

- **Future Updates:** As I learn new programming languages and techniques, I will incorporate them into these applications.

### Current Projects

1. **ATM Simulation:**
   - This project simulates an ATM machine's functionality. It includes features like checking the balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.
   - The app will be updated with new features and enhancements over time, as I continue to refine my skills.

You can explore the different branches to see the various versions of each application. Each branch represents a specific stage of development, showcasing the progress made over time.
