# Simple Real-World Applications 🚀

Welcome to my collection of simple real-world applications! This repository is where I apply what I've learned in programming by creating basic apps that solve real problems.

## What's Inside 🗂️

Each app in this repository is straightforward, focusing on a specific concept or problem. You'll find:

- **Code Files**: Each application is contained in a single java file and a README file.
- **Program Details**: Each program's folder contains details about the app, including what it does and it features.

## What's Next 🔜

Stay tuned! I'm just getting started with small projects, but I'm working towards building bigger projects and real apps that will blow your mind. 💥

I would love to hear your feedback or collaborate on future projects:
